\chapter{Useful Mathematical Rules and Constructs}

This section gives examples of useful mathematical rules or constructs that the reader most likely learned in secondary but, not having much reason to use since, may have forgotten.  It may be useful to review these as a reminder before undertaking serious work in mathematics.  One of the beauties of mathematics is that each step is built on those that came before it, so once you have mastered something it will be useful in later study.  The downside is that if you miss something or misunderstand something and it is not picked up and remedied quickly you can be lost forever.  In the opinion of the author, many of the problems that people have with mathematics, and the reason (besides Anderson's Law (\ref{qt:AndersonsLaw})) why mathematics heavy subjects are considered hard, stem from not having concepts missed, or misunderstood, early remedied quickly.  This is supported by the oft reported experience of everything making sense up to a point, then nothing making sense.
