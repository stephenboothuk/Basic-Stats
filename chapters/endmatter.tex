\part{End Matter} \label{End Matter}

This publication was typeset, probably quite poorly, in \LaTeXe by the author to help him document the statistics knowledge needed to complete his BCS/ISEB Level 7 MSc in Data Science as it had been 30 years since he had last studied statistics in anger.  It should not be taken as a definitive, complete or authoritative source.

The information in this document have been compiled from a wide variety of sources, as the saying goes ``To steal from one source is plagiarism, to steal from many is research'', in which case this is a very well researched work.  

Updates, additions, changes and corrections may be made as and when deemed necessary.
